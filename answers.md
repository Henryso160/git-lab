Comments


for git hub, my console would not allow for me to upload any files remotely, saying remote: Support for password authentacation was removed August 13, 2021. The other remote authentacation was not sucessfull. I have completed as much of the lab as possible.


I'm working to try and get my lab computer log in recovered, but I have not heard back as of yet.
